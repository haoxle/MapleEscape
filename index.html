        <p>
          Welcome adventurer, I need your help! These monsters have taken my
          weapon and I need you to retrieve this for me. Press the START button
          and you will be transported into the map. The monster have formed a
          pack and will lead you to the wrong direction, plan your journey
          wisely to waste no time! I warn you, these monsters are incredibly
          sticker, one wrong move and you will have to start again. I wish you
          the best of luck.
